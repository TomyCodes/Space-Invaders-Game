# Space Invaders Gamer

## Description
I built this Space Invaders Shooter game as a passion project and a way for me to practice Python and Object-Oriented programming. I did all my coding on pycharm and used Tech with Tim's tutorial as a reference. I struggled mostly with the OOP in the project, but the videos by Tech with Tim helped me understand it better. I used Python and the os, random, and pygame libraries. 

## Usage

In order to get this program to work, you will need to import the os, random, and pygame libraries. Installing pygame is a bit trickier because you'll have to open command prompt and type in "pip" followed by "pip install pygame".
```sh
pip
pip install pygame
```
Importing pygame, os, and random

```python
import pygame
import os
import random
```
